# Recap of My 2023

First time to breathed without a mask after 3 years of the pandemic, but I found myself still sticking to the slow-paced, holiday lifestyle.
Less open source contribution compared to last year, and less time spent on reading books or even playing games, but I still feel my time was stolen.

Some bad decisions were made.

Some good decisions were given up.

> I know it sucks that I'm releasing this post in **February 2024** but I've really been busy. I'm sorry.

## Books I Read

- *The Game Console 2.0: A Photographic History from Atari to Xbox* by Evan Amos
  -  I'm not one of those super nostalgic guys. I don't have a chance to place my hands on game consoles in my childhood. But this catalog still touches me.
- *Programming in Scala, 4th Ed.* by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners
  - Helped me in writing Spark code for my major course. I should have read it through so that I could have a better understanding of the paradigm of Scala, which is indeed not so *functional* as I thought.
- *Boost程序库完全开发指南：深入C++“准”标准库（第5版）* by 罗剑锋
  - Used as a reference to the paradigm of C++. Although the C++ language level of my projects is C++20, some cross-platform wheels are still needed. Boost is a good choice.
- *C++ Concurrency in Action, 2nd Ed.* by Anthony Williams
  - A lot of pages are about concurrency itself, not how to achieve it in C++.
- *Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, 6th Ed.* by John L. Hennessy and David A. Patterson
  - Failed to teach me how to *quantitatively* evaluate a computer architecture. Some so-called trends are not so convincing, as it was written back then when Intel just brought out Broadwell.
- *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd Ed.* by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron
  - Studied with the CTF study group. Covered some blind spots in my knowledge of computer systems.

## Electronic Widgets

- StarFive VisionFive 2
  - Its performance is way worse than I expected. Also, the GPU driver sucks. FU to Imagination.
- Orange Pi 5
  - The GPU driver sucks too, but at least it is upstreamed.
- Macbook Pro 2020 M1
  - Nice but I still wish that I had chosen Air instead since the Touch Bar is useless.
- iPhone 12 Mini
  - Fun as a toy. Battery life is a disaster.
- MOONDROP NEKOCAKE
  - Bad audio quality even compared with other TWS. Their next generation turned out to be even cheaper so no reason to buy this one.
- MOMA LARK M1
  - I messed up my only chance to talk, so not much to say. I do wish it came with a USB DAC built-in.

## Technology Achevements

- Wrote my first [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/shirok1/vf2-note/blob/master/arch/mesa-vf2/PKGBUILD).
  - It is for VisionFive 2's GPU driver.
- Participated in my first CTF.
  - Worked out 1.5 challenges. Although I mainly worked on reverse I'm still lacking in knowledge of computer systems.
- Wrote my first MitM script.
  - Almost every iOS app's unconditional trust system level certification store, making MitM scripting unbelievably easy. (Well, Apple's signature system makes it impossible to patch binary anyway.)
  - What I use is Loon. Its functionality is way beyond what I expected for a "proxy" app. But its packet capture is unintuitive.
- Wrote my first website.
  - Here it is.
- Wrote my first keygen.
  - See [this post](/posts/2024/01/11-writing-a-keygen-for-stata).

## Looking Forward

Get out of depression.
