# Opening Chapter

This is it. Built with :icon{name="logos:nuxt-icon"} Nuxt and :icon{name="logos:unocss"} UnoCSS.

The most fustrating part for me is building the "shirok1 dot dev" key visual. I hate absolute constraint coordinations, but it turns out that my ability in CSS is definitely pathetic to finish this task even with hard-coded values, not mention doing it in a *flex* approach.
