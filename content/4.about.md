My name is Shiroki Satsuki, an undergraduate (21-25) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen.

My GitHub username is [@shirok1](https://github.com/shirok1). I host most of my projects there.

If you're looking for an introduction to the site itself, you should go to [opening chapter](/posts/2023/12/13-opening-chapter) instead.

## Interested area

I major in data science, so whether I like it or not, I have to experience those technologies, including :icon{name="simple-icons:apachehadoop"} Hadoop, :icon{name="simple-icons:apachespark"} Spark, :icon{name="simple-icons:r"} R, and :icon{name="file-icons:stata"} Stata. Oh, and :icon{name="simple-icons:python"} Python, of course.

But when it comes to personal projects, I prefer :icon{name="simple-icons:rust"} Rust than any other language.

By learning Rust, I also came across concepts introduced by functional programming. I have tried :icon{name="simple-icons:fsharp"} F#, :icon{name="simple-icons:elixir"} Elixir and :icon{name="simple-icons:haskell"} Haskell. However, I havenâ€™t had a chance to use them in actual world programming since I have yet to figure out suitable scenarios.

## Working equipments

I daily drive an ASUS Zephyrus M16 since 2021. I added a 2TB SSD from ZhiTai for additional storage and set up a dual-boot to Linux like Arch and Ubuntu.

But I switch to a MacBook Pro 2020 M1 in 2023. It was bought from a second-hand dealer in Huaqiangbei. That's what you will do when your school happen to be in Shenzhen.
